# Movie-Shop-Inventory
Manipulates a database of various tables of information for a movie store. Program utilizes transformation functions, stored procedures, triggers, and complex queries to create and maintain detail and summary tables that answer analytical business questions aiding physical layout and advertisement decisions.

SCENARIO: Data analysts frequently transform data within a database so that it can be used for analysis and so that the data will be easier for nontechnical users to use and understand. You will emulate such a process in this task by choosing your own business question to analyze, creating tables and queries to use as a business report, and streamlining your analysis by writing your own SQL functions, triggers, and stored procedures. This task defines a report as a collection of data that answers a real-world business question. Your report will have two distinct sections (SQL tables that you will create) that differ in the granularity of the data they present and how directly they support the answering of the business question you choose. The detailed table should contain all data that informs the answer to the question at a very granular level, and the summary table should contain aggregated data that provide a direct answer to the business question. 

One practical business report derived from the DVD Dataset involves creating a spatial mapping of the store's physical layout based on the distribution of movies across different categories. For instance, a traditional brick-and-mortar DVD store (i.e. Blockbuster) could leverage genre-specific movie counts to strategically allocate floor space. By prioritizing genres with higher inventory, the store can optimize its layout to enhance advertising, marketing effectiveness, sales, and overall organization. This approach ensures that larger categories receive adequate display space, improving customer navigation and satisfaction. 

The detailed table will provide comprehensive data on the number of unique movie titles and total inventory counts per category. This information is crucial for effectively allocating shelf space and determining the total number of shelves required. Understanding the total inventory count for each movie category is essential for strategic floor space planning and informs decisions regarding the placement of advertisements and marketing materials. Categories with a larger number of titles offer customers a broader selection and helps to better plan the overall floor layout.

The summary table serves as a concise reference tool for marketers, advertisers, and planners to establish section headings, posters, and signage within the store and optimize the layout to attract customers to well-stocked sections. Its primary objective is to provide quick insights into section sizes, aiding planners in efficient layout planning. The total inventory count will be helpful in knowing how the individual films should be organized on shelves and to determine which categories will have titles in an overstock area.
